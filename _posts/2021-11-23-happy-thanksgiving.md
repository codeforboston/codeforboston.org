title: Happy Thanksgiving from Code for Boston!

Greetings Civic Hackers!

I’ve been spending the last week reading [Andy Slavitt’s Preventable](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C7996398). If you enjoyed The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis, this is an interesting sequel written by someone who was in the room(s) where it happened when it came to the national effort to battle COVID-19. Slavitt, who went viral on twitter a while back, does a great job of telling his stories and many of them have Civic Tech angles.

What we’re reading & watching:
- [Rick Klau shares some big news on California’s digital vaccine record](https://twitter.com/rklau/status/1463278766256390144?s=21)

On The Move:
- Congratulations to Alex Lawrence on [being named Mayor Wu’s interim Chief Information Officer](https://twitter.com/a_law12/status/1462774723432132617?s=21)
