title: New Folks Welcome In Person Next Week!
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

For the first time since March 2020 are welcoming new members to attend Code for Boston in-person at CIC in Kendall Square. On a monthly basis the first Tuesday will be in-person new member orientation for folks that want to get acquainted with us. We hope this will expand the opportunities to get involved and provide a more vibrant in-person experience.

I have also created a new [#software-engineering channel](https://cfb-public.slack.com/archives/C03988GC42W) in the Code for Boston slack. A bit of an oversight this has not existed previously, it’s a space to discuss general software ideas and topics that don’t fit into specific projects. I shared my [tool list](https://github.com/stars/mzagaja/lists/tools-i-use) to get things rolling.
