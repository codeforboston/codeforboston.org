title: MA Unveils Digital Vaccine Cards!
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

This week Massachusetts unveiled a [website where you can get your vaccine records and download a digital version of your vaccine card for your phone](https://myvaxrecords.mass.gov/). Rick Klau, CIO of California, [breaks down why this is a big deal](https://twitter.com/rklau/status/1473422299751534594). I got my verification in about ten minutes.

I also want to invite you to join the [Code for America Discourse Community](https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/). It is an open forum where folks from brigades across the country can share their thoughts, ideas, and make connections. I made a [thread asking what workshops Code for Boston should host this year](https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/brigade-workshop-programming-ideas/1133).


What we’re reading & watching:
- New York City started using automated enforcement cameras on its buses to enforce bus lanes. [You won’t believe what happened next](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/bus-lane-blocked-enforcement-cameras-can-fight-back).
- A [nerdy breakdown of this new web3 thing from the founder of Signal](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html).
- [A Vision of Sustainable Liberation for Justice-Impacted People](https://www.ted.com/talks/brittany_k_barnett_a_vision_of_sustainable_liberation_for_justice_impacted_people) is a talk about innovation languishing in America’s prisons.
