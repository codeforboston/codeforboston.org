title: Where the Chief of Streets Has a Name
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

We were excited to learn today that former Boston CIO [Jascha Franklin-Hodge has been named Mayor Wu’s Chief of Streets](https://twitter.com/jfh/status/1468245847456559111?s=21). Jascha is a Boston resident that did lots of great work when he was at DOIT. I had the pleasure of working with him briefly as part of the [Youth Jobs project](https://youthjobs.mapc.org) I did at MAPC and am excited to see what sorts of innovative ideas he will bring to the streets of Boston.

What we’re reading & watching:
- If you want a fun story about government procurement officers preventing a mess, [this episode of John Carreyou’s Bad Blood](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-9-the-military/id1575738174?i=1000533010771) podcast was a riveting look into how Elizabeth Holmes tried to pressure the military into buying Theranos technology that was not yet proven.
