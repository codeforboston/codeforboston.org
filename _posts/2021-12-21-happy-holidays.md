Greetings Civic Hackers!

Last night we met to discuss our plans for 2022. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the world with COVID-19 and the rise of Omicron, but we have concluded that our programming for 2022 is going to be primarily virtual. We hope to be able to take advantage of our outdoor space at the CIC as the weather gets nicer in the Spring, but until then are relegated to the indoors. We are exploring the possibility of providing rapid testing on top our existing vaccine requirement in order to allow folks to comfortably meet as the Omicron wave tapers.

We are also excited for some of the new projects and programming that we’re planning for in 2022. We expect our [advocacy maps](https://codeforboston.github.io/advocacy-maps/) project to restart with a new set of work. We’re planning an interesting project to tackle climate change with the [HeatSmart Alliance](https://heatsmartalliance.org). We are also looking to run more workshops and other programming to help folks level up their coding skills and help our partners throughout the year.

The Software Engineer applies engineering best practices to public transit software systems and products. Sometimes this means coding new applications from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the community has to offer. We use cloud services, open-source software, and modern tools as much as possible. Knowing what to build and reuse ensures that we optimize our time and efforts so we can focus on delivering the best value to our riders.
