title: Demo Night Videos are Live!
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

I am excited to share that we now have all the videos from our Demo Night on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/codeforboston). If you did not get a chance to attend the event in person I hope you will take the opportunity to watch and learn about the impactful work our volunteers have done over the past two years.

What We’re Reading and Watching: 

- Bloomberg Philanthropies is [investing in data capacity for cities](https://www.bloomberg.org/press/new-bloomberg-philanthropies-city-data-alliance-launches-in-the-u-s-latin-america-and-canada-with-60-million-investment/). Worth checking out if your city is interested in building its data capacity. 
- The [CDC is asking its staff to improve how it collects health data](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/21/cdc-email-data-walensky-00018614). 
- [Frustration: One Year with R](https://github.com/ReeceGoding/Frustration-One-Year-With-R) is a hypercritical tome on the challenges of using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). I personally prefer to [do data science in Ruby](https://ankane.org/rails-meet-data-science) and Python.
- Dan Hon [now has an ebook collection of his essays on technology](https://store.verylittlegravitas.com/l/ThingsVol1) including many with a Civic Tech bend.
