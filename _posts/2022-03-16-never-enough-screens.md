title: Never Enough Screens
---
As we ramp up our in-person involvement one of the challenges we face is the lack of screens. When we run Zoom we have the big presentation on the TV in CIC along with useful audio, but the virtual audience is missing. Conversely in Zoom we get a great camera angle of me presenting, but no sense of the audience. As I though through how many screens we truly needed to get Zoom to do what we want, I made my way to four:
* Big slideshow screen for room.
* Big Zoom audience screen for room.
* Zoom audience view for presenter
* Slideshow view for presenter.

We then want at least two camera feeds into the Zoom from the main room. One to show the speaker and another to show the audience in the room. Doing hybrid suddenly sounds a bit complicated, but it is part of the growing pains we are enduring as we figure this all out. If you have ideas for how to best set this all up, [send me a note](mailto:mattz@codeforboston.org).

In the meantime we’ll keep experimenting and see how we can best deliver our programming both in-person and online without breaking the bank.
