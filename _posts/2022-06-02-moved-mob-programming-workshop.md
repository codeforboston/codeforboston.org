title: Moved Mob Programming Workshop...
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

As folks (myself) included have been recovering from COVID we’ve been shifting things around to accommodate. As a result our mob programming workshop that was supposed to be this past week [is now June 14th](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Crafters/events/285576929/). The good news is nobody has gotten COVID from attending Code for Boston so far. We encourage folks to rapid test before attending our event with [free tests from the federal government](https://special.usps.com/testkits) or reimbursed by your insurance company. Some weeks when it is nice out we have access to the outdoor fifth floor terrace at CIC, and encourage folks to mask indoors when they are not eating. While we cannot make attending an in-person event risk-free, we can all take steps to minimize the spread of COVID.

What We’ve Been Reading and Watching:

- [Molly White is becoming crypto’s biggest critic](https://wapo.st/3x2eQg9) is an interesting Washington Post article about a Bay Stater who thinks all crypto projects may not be what they seem.
- [How tech can be a force for good in government](https://wapo.st/3lZAdIO) is a profile of Garlin Gilchrist, the Lt. Governor of Michigan.
- [What America needs is a liberalism that builds](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/opinion/biden-liberalism-infrastructure-building.html?unlocked_article_code=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEIPuomT1JKd6J17Vw1cRCfTTMQmqxCdw_PIxftm3iWka3DIDmwTiOMNAo6B_EGKb6tvat122zWRScVINL40QblzyOFFNldxURSjvoaeldEPPiQxpYO1USU2w5fJF_gewAPdU1OYeq151aHt-FWPKiSxCvmIz3YrdFth8ZdnaVqvjiYXwqnPFvp_2YUqwa0iVZx-RmpWZSHZ7eL6SEkrYKXwZRrZ4wk9W-lfSGuTyYbas-RcBV0UXVHWT3p_4nI-7MddOb4UNKX5LB0ne6nukOlbSzwofMryWcpHF8WDnK5qsLXNtRWI1MG9ov09H6hUt7_E2X2oJ9NVUM7DIxDsUbBkotJChQ&smid=url-share) has been making the rounds in #CivicTech twitter.

### [Mob Programming and TDD Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IhVHif_YHBigiJCA1zY0IwwdtHXWX28XqRCsuxJOSzM/edit#heading=h.4ipjp8tf74m0)

All experience levels welcome! Spend two hours mob programming features for the “Mob Timer Kata”.  Learn about TDD and Typescript/Jest by doing it.

Mob Programming is a technique for facilitating a group of people working collaboratively on one computer. TDD is a powerful technique where you write tests before writing one line of code and your design evolves from the tests.
