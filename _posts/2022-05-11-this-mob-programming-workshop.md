Greetings Civic Hackers!

At the end of May we will be hosting a mob programming workshop lead by our own Ethan Strominger. More information can be found on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IhVHif_YHBigiJCA1zY0IwwdtHXWX28XqRCsuxJOSzM/edit#heading=h.4ipjp8tf74m0) and you can [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfkQRv5GSJh_osYvce5oAdJVyn2pbDadY7IDf1Rv21yixmBg/viewform).

Also TED finally posted Code for America CEO [Amanda Renteria‚Äôs talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_renteria_a_bold_plan_to_transform_access_to_the_us_social_safety_net) about their plan to transform with the social safety net with the $60 million they received from The Audacious Project.

Also I was excited to see the Commonwealth of Massachusetts [now offers free telehealth consultations for Paxlovid prescriptions](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/free-telehealth-for-covid-19-treatment-with-paxlovid). If you‚Äôve been wondering how to get a prescription, this is a great resource.

All experience levels welcome! Spend two hours mob programming features for the ‚ÄúMob Timer Kata‚Äù.  Learn about TDD and Typescript/Jest by doing it.

Mob Programming is a technique for facilitating a group of people working collaboratively on one computer. TDD is a powerful technique where you write tests before writing one line of code and your design evolves from the tests.
