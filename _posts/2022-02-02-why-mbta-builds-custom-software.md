Greetings Civic Hackers!

I was excited to read [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/mcplanner/status/1487886893744156672?s=21) about why the MBTA builds custom software. Ruth Miller does a great job of explaining what lead to that path and why it means the MBTA can provide better service to folks in Massachusetts.
