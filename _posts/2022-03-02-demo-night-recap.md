title: Demo Night Recap
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

We had a great Demo Night event last week which is why we took the week off the newsletter. Recorded talks are coming soon to YouTube, but we had six different Code for Boston projects present on their work and impact. With about forty folks participating in person and forty people participating virtually we managed to achieve a good amount of participation. It was great to see many folks in-person for the first time for a while. We hope to do another one of these next year.

What We’re Reading and Watching:
- [A People-First Approach Improving Government Customer Experience Through Technology](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/news/improving-government-customer-experience/) is an interesting recording of a Civic Tech talk hosted by Georgetown.

## Events
### [NYC Open Data Week](https://2022.open-data.nyc) 
Open Data Week is an annual festival of community-driven events organized and produced by the NYC Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics and BetaNYC. Every year, New Yorkers come together all across the five boroughs to celebrate New York City’s Open Data Law, which was signed into law on March 7, 2012. Coincidentally, the first weekend of March is also International Open Data Day.  With these dates anchoring Open Data Week, we rally NYC’s civic tech and open data communities and offer opportunities for more people to learn about and engage with municipal open data.
