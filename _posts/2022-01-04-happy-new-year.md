Greetings Civic Hackers!

It is a new year and we are excited to share some plans for the next few months. First we are welcoming long time Code for Boston volunteer Nhi into our organizing team to focus on new member engagement and communication. We are hoping to better share the stories of the great work our project teams are doing and spin up some new ways for folks to engage with us throughout 2022. Stay tuned as we announce these opportunities.
