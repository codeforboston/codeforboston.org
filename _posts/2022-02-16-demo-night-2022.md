Greetings Civic Hackers!

Next week is our first demo night in two years. This hybrid event will be both in-person at the CIC Venture Cafe and virtual on the [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) website. We are excited to share the impact and lessons from the projects we have been working on since we last convened demos in 2019. If you want to join us either in-person or virtually [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code-for-boston-demo-night-2022-tickets-260802315747). We hope to see you there!
