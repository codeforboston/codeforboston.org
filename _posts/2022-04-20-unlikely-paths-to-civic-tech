title: Unlikely Paths to Civic Tech!
---
Greetings Civic Hackers!

It's Nhi, again. (Matt will be back next week with the usual programming.) Besides unlikely people in civic tech, there are also 
unlikely paths to civic tech. While most people, who join Code for Boston and civic tech in general, are fresh out of school, some people are from unlikely places.

You probably already know that our team leader, Matt, used to be a lawyer before he switched to being a software engineer. Of course, these two career paths couldn't 
be more different. The career move didn't happen over night either. He attended Harvard University on a full scholarship to further his education and change his career. 
Another team leader and project lead, Thad, also has an interesting origin story. He used to work in the Peace Corps for 2 years to teach desktop computing and 
system administraton in Tanzania. You wouldn't be able to tell he can speak fluent Swahili by just looking at him. As for me, I worked in video 
production for almost 10 years and decided to go back to school and study full stack web development because I wanted a skill that would allow me to work regular work days/hours. 
I also chose web development because I used to make basic websites as a child for fun and wished someone told me earlier that I could do that for money.

What was your path to civic tech?
