# **Communications Lead**

# About this role

**Code for Boston is looking for a volunteer communications lead to run our communications efforts, helping to tell the stories of our civic technology work and how it positively impacts our governmental and non-profit partners and the constituents they serve in the Greater Boston area.**

As Communications Lead, you’ll work closely with Code for Boston members to create content that helps us to connect with current and future members, partners, and funders. You’ll get people excited about Code for Boston’s work through written and multimedia content, leading to new impactful projects, and growing out membership. You may also be called upon to work with partners to develop content for projects, connecting our technology products to the people who need them most. While this sounds like a fair bit of work, you’ll be able to build a volunteer communications team to support you in these efforts.

The role of communications lead is open to a variety of experience levels: experienced communication professionals may find this challenge a rewarding way to give back to the Boston community, while those just getting started may also find it a great way to build a portfolio. As with all leadership positions at Code for Boston, we expect that you’ll be able to dedicate about 3-5 hours each week over the course of a year.


# What you can expect to do in your first few months…

* **Hang out with all the Code for Boston project teams**: You’ll spend time getting to know our members and the projects they’re working on through Zoom calls, in Slack, and (only if you like!) in person at our Tuesday evening hack nights. You’ll also learn about historical Code for Boston projects, events, and other initiatives that might make for compelling content.
* **Get writing**: Code for Boston has a variety of communication channels that we use to connect with our members, partners, and the Greater Boston community, including Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, and our weekly newsletter. Over the first few weeks, you’ll be onboarded onto all of those platforms and can start generating content, beginning with the newsletter.
* **Own the Code for Boston communications capacity**: You’ll work with Code for Boston leadership to develop a communications plan. In general you will be responsible for managing and completing your own task portfolio, and following up with others on the Code for Boston team that need to do things to support you.


# We want to hear from you if you are..

* **A great writer and a great listener**: As communications lead, you’ll own our primary communications channels on social media, blogging, and newsletter, so a strong ability with the written word is pretty much a given. You’ll also be  translating the work of project teams and partners into a variety of formats, so interviewing and listening skills are critical as well.
* **Comfortable with video and audio**: We’d love to expand our multimedia footprint through the creation of short project videos, explainers, streaming content, podcasts, and more. If you have experience with these or are interested in rolling up your sleeves to learn, this may be a gig for you.
* **Mission-driven volunteer**: Code for Boston is a 100% volunteer community, and our members are here because we want to give back to our local community, using technology and design to help our neighbors.
