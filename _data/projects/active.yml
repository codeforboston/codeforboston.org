    HFCU was recently charted as a federal credit union. This change has expanded those eligible for membership in the HFCU to include those living in census tracts that are considered underserved by traditional banks.  This project is focused in making it easier for someone interested in membership to determine if they live in one of these census tracts and eligible to join.

    Residential heating accounts for over 15% of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts. Transitioning from fossil-fuel heating systems to heat pumps is a key step in the state's overall decarbonization strategy, but appropriately sizing heat pumps is critical to realizing their full decarbonization benefit. This project involves moving a calculator tool from an Excel spreadsheet into a web application to improve the workflow of volunteer Heat Pump Coaches and later make the tool more accessible to the public.

- name: Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator
  elevatorPitch: >
    Through this project and its grant, the Urban League plans to hire folks to engage in outreach to homeowners in traditionally underserved communities so they are aware of and can access incentives and resources to convert their HVAC to environmentally friendly air source heat pumps. This will help the Commonwealth reach its goals in the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan. It will also reduce the cost of heating and cooling homes for residents in these communities, keeping more of their money in the community and reducing reliance on volatile natural gas or home heating oil prices.
