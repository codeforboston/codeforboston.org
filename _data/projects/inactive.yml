    Urban Planning with Virtual Reality: Inman Square Intersection

    We're looking to create a moderately realistic model of the Inman Square intersection redesign as a way to communicate the City's plans and progress to the public. We'll also be testing how VR affects public opinion on a contentious planning issue.

    Need skills:

    - Sketchup or 3D modeling software in general
    - Unity or AFrame
    - Research / survey design

    No VR experience required.
