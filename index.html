  <h1>Code for Boston</h1>
  <h2>
    A grassroots organization.
  </h2>

   <p>
    Code for Boston addresses local social and civic challenges through creative
    uses of technology. Despite the name, we are not solely focused on coding! We
    foster relationships between government, nonprofit, academic, for-profit
    companies, residents, civic technologists, analysts, designers, and many
    more. All are welcome!
