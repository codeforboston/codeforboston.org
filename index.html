        <h3 class="alert-heading">We are temporarily suspending in-person hack nights</h3>

        <p>
            In light of the ongoing concerns around COVID-19&mdash;and based on
            guidance from Code for America and our hosts at the Cambridge
            Innovation Center&mdash; we have made the difficult decision to
            shift to <strong>virtual hack nights</strong> starting <strong>Tuesday, March 10</strong>.
            Please check on Slack or Meetup for further details.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a temporary phase! With your help, we&rsquo;ll keep our community
            strong and stay on mission to improve the lives of everyone in the
            Greater Boston area through design and technology.
