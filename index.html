    <p>Code for Boston addresses local social and civic challenges through creative uses of technology.  Despite the name, we're not solely focused on coding!  We foster relationships between government, nonprofit, academic, for-profit companies, residents, civic technologists, analysts, designers, and many more.  All are welcome!</p>
