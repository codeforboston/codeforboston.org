    <h2>What is Civic Technology?</h2>
    <p>The definition of civic tech can be quite unclear sometimes - here is a great starting point: <a href="https://medium.com/@grodeska/civictech-primer-what-is-civic-tech-7ea788e766d3#.lr9joeu39">#CivicTech Primer: What is “civic tech”?
    </a> </p>
    <p>The gist of it is that civic tech is using technology in a creative way to help better the lives of individuals in our communities, whether that is through person-to-person interactions, or via person-to-government interactions.</p>
    <p>It is also worth reading <a href="https://www.civictechs.com">Andrew Schrock's introduction to Civic Tech</a>.</p>
