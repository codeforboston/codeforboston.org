    <h2>What is Code for Boston?</h2>
    <p>Code for Boston is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup. We are part of the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/about">Code for America Brigade network</a>, and are made up of developers, designers, data geeks, citizen activists, and many others who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.

    <h2>What is Civic Technology?</h2>
    <p>The definition of civic tech can be quite unclear sometimes - here is a great starting point: <a href="https://medium.com/@grodeska/civictech-primer-what-is-civic-tech-7ea788e766d3#.lr9joeu39">#CivicTech Primer: What is “civic tech”?
    </a> </p>
    <p>The gist of it though, if you want a quick summary, is that civic tech is using technology in a creative way to help better the lives of individuals in our communities, whether that is through person-to-person interactions, or via person-to-government interactions.</p>
